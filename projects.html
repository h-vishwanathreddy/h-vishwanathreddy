            <p class="b">- Bookstorify is a online book store management system which assists the Students and Faculties
                to access the books from their University Library. <br> The user will be able to search the database to find
                the book they want, check the
                availability using the book title from the stock. <br> If the Refereed book is available, the user can borrow
                the book.

            <p class="b">- Automation Anywhere Enterprise Edition, Bot Lab, AARI <small>(Nov 2021 - Jan 2022)</small></p>
            <p class="b">-If an investor is looking for a particular stock to invest in,there goes a fair amount of time spent researching and
                studying the market trend. <br> In the present collection of top NIFTY 50 stocks which are fundamentally very strong
                and can yield the investor good returns in the future it becomes tedious for the investor to frequently look for the
                data of the stocks in the NSE website. <br> Here we are building a bot that would account for the parameters such as
                Open, High, Low, Close, Percentage Change and recommend the best stock to buy/sell at any given point of time all by
                a single click.
